# Gathered.
LINK: (https://gathered-app.herokuapp.com/)

Summary: Gathered is a community for connecting with restaurants, farms, markets and other sources of local, sustainable food. The application currently allows users to create a listing for a vendor, and to join the community by becoming a member. In the future, I would like to add more features, such as a social media aspect where users can 'like' different vendors, and comment on the separate vendor pages. I would also like to include geo-location via Google Maps, so users can search near them for local vendors.

Technologies Used: Node.js, Mongoose, Express, EJS, Bootstrap, CSS, Heroku, RESTful Routes, MVC structure.

Approach: I used the above technologies to make an app that utilizes all 7 RESTful routes in order to give users the ability to add new vendors, edit them, delete them, and view them within the web app. I also added a second model for users to be able to create a user profile that allows the same create/view/edit/delete functionality. There is also user authentication built in via sessions and bcrypt, allowing for specific user-member targeted routes and content. I styled the app with Bootstrap and did a heavy amount of customization with my own CSS as well.

Unsolved Problems: As I mentioned above, I would like to see the site have more features, especially for signed-in users. Comment sections and 'likes' were something I had originally wanted to include, but just ran out of time with the deadline. Same goes for the Google Maps integration. I also didn't have time to make all of the routes for separate categories. I would like to add an e-commerce/shopping functionality to the app as well, where vendors can sell list their goods for sale. I plan on going back to all of this, because this project was actually inspired by a real-life discussion of such an app with a friend, and he asked if I could create it for him.
